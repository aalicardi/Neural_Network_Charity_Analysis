# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

##Overview
Using machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup, a non-profit foundation.

### Purpose
Create a classifer that can achieve results above 75%.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing the dataset in order to compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model later

What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
* IS_SUCCESSFUL

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
* APPLICATION_TYPE
* AFFILIATION
* CLASSIFICATION
* USE_CASE
* ORGANIZATION
* INCOME_AMT
* SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS
* ASK_AMT

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
* EIN
* NAME

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
